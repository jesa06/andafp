# Overall
I got 41/50 on this multiple choice quiz. I was pretty confident and I thought I understood all of the questions. I realized that I just did not pay attention to some of the wording or what the question was really asking, because I was working through it really fast.

# Topics to Review
1. Binary and decimal conversions
2. Completing code segments/choosing correct code segments to a certain function
3. Network Connections
4. Sequential vs. Parallel Computing
5. Combining processes in computing
