# Lesson 3.3-3.4 Homework Grade   
- I received a 1/1 on the homework grading. I think I did a really good on note taking, I focused on writing about key vocabulary terms and including examples from in class. I made sure to write my notes in ways that I understood the topics. 
I completed all of the practice problems with explanations and demonstrated what I knew. I added comments within my practice code to make sure I understood what the code meant. 
- "You attempted all of the problems with good explanations for most which show that you understand the core concept. The notes and effort are great."
- *What I learned*: I learned how to break down code segments and analyzing different values in lists. I learned how to use concat, len(), and substring to evaluate strings. I also leaned how to analyze different parts of the code, through selection, realizing the sequence is all of the code steps, and that iteration is repeatedly going through a certain part of a code until it reaches the correct condition. I also learned arithmetic operations which just incorporates simple math into the code segments, like adding the length of different parts of words, and dividing it by another number. 
 
- I received a 1/1 on the homework grading. I made sure to incorporate key vocabulary, practice problems, and homework hacks. I made sure to check over what questions were wrong or hard, and I reviewed them. 
- "Completed all the necessary parts and went above and beyond with explanations"
- +What I learned*: I learned about Booleans relating to and or, and how different true or false combinations. I also learned how to create dictionaries with Boolean values in it, and how to use if/else statements in the code, referencing to those dictionaries. It relates to while loops because it iterates until certain conditions are met. For example, True or False. Another thing I learned was to make a flowchart with pseudocode to explain the sequence of my codes and the way it iterates through it. 

# Lesson 3.8 and 3.10 Homework Grade
- I received a 0.9/1 on the homework grading, meaning I met the expectations. It said that I did not do any of the extra hacks, but I did not see extra things on there. I reflected on the quiz, the questions I got wrong and my process of thinking. I also explained what I learned through the exercises
- "Issues with notebook, probably due to images/misnamed notebooks. Good overall, nothing extra."
- *What I learned*: I learned how to structure conditional statements which connect to lists. I learned how to actually alter lists which depends on index, length, and the elements themselves. Some things were pop which would remove the last element in a list, append and extend would add on, and remove would remove a certain element in a list. I also learned how to sort lists in ascending or descending order which would work with integers (based on its numerical value) and also strings (based on the alphabet).
