# HTML Markdown Fragments
> Progress each week

| Week # | Topic/Focus | Issue/Hacks/Review Tickets | Notes/Things to remember |
|-|-|-|-|
| 0 | Tool Setup | [Tools and Equipment](https://github.com/jesa06/andafp/issues/5#issue-1354867366) | When doing hacks, post as an issue |
| 1 | Introduction to Python | [Bash and Checks](https://github.com/jesa06/andafp/issues/2#issue-1353266162), [Fastpages](https://github.com/jesa06/andafpissues/3#issue-1353457506) | We can verify versions and tools/kernels installed using different codes in Terminal |
| 2 | Data Abstraction | [Data Abstraction](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/issues/22#issuecomment-1237671401) | There are different types of loops. Index can be used to select/refer to a certain language or record or list. |
| 3 | Creative Development Sprint | [Creative Development Sprint](https://github.com/jesa06/andafp/issues/9) | Use AppLab to create a quiz and more in Javascript. Make sure in the future performance task, use loops, lists, dictionaries and more. |
| 4 | Python Web Server Project | [pBig Idea 1 "Collaboration"](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/markdown/2022/09/13/1.1CollaborationNotes.html), [Flask/Python Web Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzB7waKs60o), [Focus and Habits](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/_pages/04_PsychologyandtheGoodLife.html) | Editing through HTML, edits instantly change and you do not have to push, commit, and wait for the actions to load. For Fastpages, running Docker shows local changes, still powered by Jekyll. Run Make Server command to get the local IP Address. For Python Web Server, run main.py to obtain the local IP Address. |
| 5 | UI Starters | [AP Test Prep: Big Idea 1 "Program Purpose"](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/markdown/2022/09/20/1.2ProgramFunctionandPurposeNotes.html), [Career Tech: JavaScript Tutorial](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/HTMLJSTable/), [Human Prep: Agile Methodology](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/markdown/2022/09/25/AgileMethodology.html), [Flask Repositories (Individual and Group)](https://github.com/jesa06/andafp/issues/10) | You can add new submenus in fastpages with adding .html. Javascript is a loose typed language, JSON is a long string of information that can be used to transfer different data to different languages, *translate*. |
| 6 | Deployment| [AP Test Prep: Big Idea 1 "Program Design" ](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/markdown/2022/09/27/1.3ProgramDesignandDevelopment.html) | AWS Amazon Web Services is the host where we can push our local flask repository to for others to see (like cloud). | 
| 7 | API | [AP Test Prep: Big Idea 1 "Identifying and Correcting Errors](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/collegeboard/error), [Career Tech: Python RapidAPI](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/techtalk/rapidapi) | API gives you information or data for you to use in your site, Can print it out with.json and iterate through it to see what data you want to extract. |
| 8 | Internet Connections | [AP Test Prep: Big Idea 4 "The Internet"](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/markdown/2022/10/18/4.1Internet.html), [Career Tech: Fetch of Python Data Using RapidAPI](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/api/overview) | Internet works in layers. Information is transmitted in packets, because it cannot be transferred all at once. |
| 9 | Project Week 1-3 | [Sprint: Team Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tdkl35-OVD2tKIHRwidY_7L0JRv1R8i-/view?usp=sharing), [Human Prep: CTE](https://jesa06.github.io/andafp/markdown/2022/10/25/CTE.html) | You can use document.getElement to retrieve data from a file within a repository you are working in. It is really important to work together with your team and plan times when to code together. |
