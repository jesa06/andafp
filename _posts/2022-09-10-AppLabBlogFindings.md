# AppLab Quiz Findings 
> Hacks: Program Design with App Lab by Code.org, blog outline and results

## [My AppLab Quiz](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/zSOeVFZH3J74XKSPtFd-yuO6TCn7T15hS_0PcIz9IGU)

## Quiz Outline/Plan
1. The quiz will be about information of Del Norte High School
2. In the beginning it will be logging into an iPhone
3. Next you will open some sort of app into the quiz
4. Then the quiz will begin, going through 3 questions
5. After the questions are up, it will calculate the end score. I think i might want to w=find a way to calculate the score on the fly or as the quiz is being taken.
6. Also when the person gets the answer wrong, they will be told the answer was wrong and either be redirected to a page or just told incorrect.

## Hacks
 - Blog your “design”, “successes”, discoveries, challenges. For “design”, and “successes” try to blog according to Create Performance Task skills and rubric.
    1. **Program Purpose and Function:** The way I designed this quiz was with 3 questions, as stated in the requirements, but each question will be answered in a different way. One is a button to choose your answer, one was a dropdown to select an answer, and the last was a checkbox to choose the answer. In the start it was a challenge to actually set, define, and declare different variables. It was a little challenging to understand each control block and what it did, but after playing around with it, I understood it very well. I even added a part in the beginning 
    2. **Data Abstraction:** In this quiz, I did not store data in the list. I still am having a little bit of trouble utilizing lists and storing data in them within my projects and codes. 
    3. **Managing Complexity:** As said before, I did not use a list in this quiz but if I were to use a list within the quiz I would probably have the questions in a list with: the type of answer (dropdown, button, checkbox), the actual text of the question, and the choices. 
    4. **Procedural Abstraction:** I was able to find repetition in my code, and set a variable to replace all of that repetition. I made a variable that has a function that calculated the score of the person's quiz as they were taking it, which was in every screen from question 1 till the end, so it was a lot of repeating that code. I replaced the whole code every time it was repeated with the variable name "score."
    5. **Algorithm Implementation:** I do not have any loops in my quiz but if I were to have a loop I would probably have an input in the beginning with questions that ask some information about who is taking the quiz, which would be added to a record in my list. And then at the end I would have the loop print the information about the person who took it and their results. It would add on for ever single person who takes the quiz.
    6. **Testing:** Using the blocks and also typing in the code I was able to debug or find many errors in my code and then fix it. I had errors of missing semicolons, extra parentheses or other things. Now I am able to explain what my code with output.

If you finish your quiz early, try coming up with a different concept or idea for an app you think could work within App Lab. Remember to make a plan before you start any coding.
