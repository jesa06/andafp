## Quiz Outline/Plan
1. The quiz will be about information of Del Norte High School
2. In the beginning it will be logging into an iPhone
3. Next you will open some sort of app into the quiz
4. Then the quiz will begin, going through 3 questions
5. After the questions are up, it will calculate the end score. I think i might want to w=find a way to calculate the score on the fly or as the quiz is being taken.
6. Also when the person gets the answer wrong, they will be told the answer was wrong and either be redirected to a page or just told incorrect.

## Hacks

If you finish your quiz early, try coming up with a different concept or idea for an app you think could work within App Lab. Remember to make a plan before you start any coding.
