1. Skills I have obtained:
    - <mark>Team work/collaboration</mark>...Throughout my life in school as a student, I have always taken the lead in group projects and collaboration. In this class it was the complete opposite, I was usually one of the followers in groups for project based learning. I was probably one of the least experienced in computer science, and I took longer to understand ideas in this class. I experienced not being a leader, but being a team player not in charge. It was really different but I realized that you cannot be leader all the time, and it was actually super helpful to learn in a not leader aspect. 
    - <mark>Working to find a solution</mark>...
    - <mark>Basic code</mark>
    - <mark>Complex logical thinking</mark>
    - <mark>Basic knowledge of how computers function</mark>

2. Highs and lows from year:
    - <mark>Highs</mark>:
    - <mark>lows</mark>:
