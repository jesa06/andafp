# Overall
I got 62/66 on this multiple choice quiz which was a 94%. I was pretty confident on most of the questions and at least understood what was being asked. I did have to refer to my note and Google to refresh my memory on some topics. I think I should go over my answers a few times and reread the questions slowly.

# Topics to Review
1. Comparing loop algorithms:
- How switching the order of a step inside a loop affects the overall process or the outputs. 
- Robot algorithms to reach the square
2. How increasing/decreasing bits changes the decimal number of possibilities.
3. Creating procedures

# Questions I got Wrong
![Loops]({{site.baseurl}}/images/loops.png)
- The programs both output ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. A starts from 1 and B starts from 2.

![Robot algorithm]({{site.baseurl}}/images/robots.png)
- I need to pay attention to the steps and how you do each step and repeat that process in the same order. I accidentally did it but repeating each step 4 times. I then got confused because in the way I did it the robot would face the outside grid and have nowhere to go.

![Increasing bits]({{site.baseurl}}/images/increasingbits.png)
- I just did 128 bits - 32 bits = 96 bits. But I forgot that since it is bits it is base 2, so 2^96

![Adjusted Total]({{site.baseurl}}/images/adjustedtotals.png)
- I forgot to add the final exam score to the maximum of the previous tests. This was an easy mistake.
