binary- two options
- if the very right bit is on it will be an odd number
- if the right bit is 1 it will be an odd number
- if the left bit is 1 it will be am even number
- it is built in powers of 2, very right 2^0 and as you go left the power increases by one

abstraction- taking data and putting it into a list
