##### **Trial by Jury**- when multiple people/locals hear the case and decide together if the defendant is guilty. Supreme Court says there should be at least 6 people present. Most juries today in the United States have twelve members.
##### **Civil Cases**- refers to non-criminal cases. Criminal cases are cases where the government charges someone with a crime. If declared guilty, the person could go to jail or be fined by the court. Civil cases are usually arguments between two private citizens/organizations. The victim in a civil case usually sues for "damages."
