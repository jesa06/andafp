# Lesson 3.3-3.4 Homework Grade
- I received a 1/1 on the homework grading. I think I did a really good on note taking, I focused on writing about key vocabulary terms and including examples from in class. I made sure to write my notes in ways that I understood the topics. 
I completed all of the practice problems with explanations and demonstrated what I knew. I added comments within my practice code to make sure I understood what the code meant. 
"You attempted all of the problems with good explanations for most which show that you understand the core concept. The notes and effort are great."
- *What I learned*: I learned how to break down code segments and analyzing different values in lists. I learned how to use concat, len(), and substring to evaluate strings. I also leaned how to analyze different parts of the code, through selection, realizing the sequence is all of the code steps, and that iteration is repeatedly going through a certain part of a code until it reaches the correct condition. I also learned arithmetic operations which just incorporates simple math into the code segments, like adding the length of different parts of words, and dividing it by another number.
