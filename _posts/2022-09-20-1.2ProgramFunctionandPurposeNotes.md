# Computing Innovations
1. ## Applications
- Games
- Social Media
- Business
- Productivity
2. ## Physical Devices
- Computers
- Smart phones/tablets
- Smart "Things"
- Wearables (apple watches, things to help keep people alive/alert health or vitals)

# Inputs to Programs
1. touch/tactile
- swipe
- press
2. audio 
- voice recognition (siri)
3. visual
- facial recognition
4. text (including numbers)
- passwords


# Programs Receiving Input- events are triggered by some sort of action, which usually sends input to the program
1. mouse clicks
2. swipes
3. taps
4. certain entries or keys together
5. key words/phrases 
6. physical buttons 


# What dees Input accomplish?
- usually affects the output
- **Must follow a sequence or series for it to work**

# How does a program know what to do?
- action triggers an event (Ring doorbell)
- the program jumps to the code according to the event --> directs you to different spots/segments (as they are called, not necessarily in order) --> output is triggered

# What is a program?
- a collection of statements, often referred to as *software*
- needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations
