# Performance Task Outline 
> Hacks: Start an outline on how you will prepare for the Create Performance Task project.

## Hacks
### Outline:

 **Establish a personal or pair Scrum Board with active and future Issues-** I will have a pair to show my work with, along with my partner, either Lydia or Shruthi. 

**Start a design that _post that can be reviewed to see if it meets the basicCreate Performance Task requirements. Be sure to pick something that you donâ€™t burn out on or is not overly common-** I think for my performance task I will simulate/design a game that is a tournament situation of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. This is something I won't burn out on and it is definitely not overly common. The person playing the game will choose their strategy and different moves or techniques the player wants to do to its opponent. Scores will be held with the points, as long as advantages/disadvantages, which are in basic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Tournaments. I will even give the choice in the beginning for what team the player wants to be on, what division they want ot be in, and what gi they would like to wear. 
   I will include an input in the beginning for people to add their information/players information, this information would be added as a record into a list. The list will be of all of the existing players, with their player information and the ending score. And at the end of the game it will list out the top scores/players. 
   The game will probably ask questions regarding what move they want to make, if they are going to do that move right away or wait. These questions will possibly be in a loop.

## My preparation
I will look over all of my notes taken and my blogs demonstration different requirements, like lists, iterations, loops, etc. I will also look over examples in the collegeboard, ones that are great on including every aspect and earned great scores, and ones that did not include every aspect and lost a lot of points. I will also review the rubric and scoring as I am looking at these examples, and as I am adding onto my ideas of the performance task. During my code I will add comments, cite codes that I got from others, rearrange codes in better orders, shortening codes with variables, and just fine tuning it to be at its best.
