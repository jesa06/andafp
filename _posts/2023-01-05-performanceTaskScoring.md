# Submission 1

| Reporting Category | My Score + Explanation | Collegeboard Score + Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | TBD | 0, Does not have distinguished program purpose, instead, it is too broad and just described the functionality. Everything was good except the written response. | 
| Data Abstraction | TBD | 1, 2 segments of code are provided, one with a named list. The written response is great and the code segments are distinguished |
| Managing Complexity | TBD | 0, The list does not manage complexity. The explanation of how the program could be written differently without lists and how lists were helpful is inaccurate. |
| Procedural Abstraction | TBD | 1, there is a developed and named procedure with 3 parameters used and referenced later on in the code. The output response includes code that calls the procedure again. The student describes how the procedure functions and it is essential to the program overall. |
| Algorithm Implementation | TBD | 1 |
| Testing | TBD | 1 |
