# Submission 1

| Reporting Category | My Scoring | Collegeboard Score + Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0, Does not have distinguished program purpose, instead, it is too broad and just described the functionality. Everything was good except the written response. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1, 2 segments of code are provided, one with a named list. The written response is great and the code segments are distinguished |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0, The list does not manage complexity. The explanation of how the program could be written differently without lists and how lists were helpful is inaccurate. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1, there is a developed and named procedure with 3 parameters used and referenced later on in the code. The output response includes code that calls the procedure again. The student describes how the procedure functions and it is essential to the program overall. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 1, the student incorporated their own algorithm within their procedure. They used selection (if), sequencing, and iteration (for in range loop). The written response is detailed explaining how the algorithm functions in the procedure, so it could be remade. |
| Testing | 1 | 1, The written response describes two different calls to the procedure with different parameters. For each call, the student describes the conditions that are being tested. Lastly, the results of both of the calls are described. |

| Reporting Category | My Score + Explanation | Collegeboard Score + Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1, The response specifies the program’s purposeas entertainment. It describes how it functions, the input of "placing and removing tiles" and the output of patterns. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1, 2 code segments are provided. One of the multiple list's name is startGrid. The response says what is being stored in the list, which is the possible tiles on the screen. |
| Managing Complexity | 0, does not include the procedure name in the list. | 1, The response includes code that uses a list to manage complexity. It explains how the code could not be written without using a list. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1, The response includes a created procedure, "replaceList", with 2 parameters, current and replacement. The response also includes a description of the functionality and a call to this procedure. The response describes the functionality of the procedure. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1, The created algorithm in the procedure, replaceList, includes sequencing, selection and iteration. The response explains how the algorithm functions can be recreated in another way. |
| Testing | 1 | 1, The response describes 2 different calls to the procedure which results in different code being ran through. The response states that the second call is “parameter inputs of 2, 1, being the current and replacement parameters respectively.” The response describes both of the conditions being tested. | 

##  Create Performance Task scoring on these examples will help me exceed CPT requirements because it gives me good and bad examples of the written portion. It helps me figure out what is required, what is extra, and what is not needed in the explanation. The scoring will help me realize what I need included in my written response.
