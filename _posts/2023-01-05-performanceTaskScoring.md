# Submission 1

| Reporting Category | My Score + Explanation | Collegeboard Score + Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | TBD | 0, Does not have distinguished program purpose, instead, it is too broad and just described the functionality. Everything was good except the written response. | 
| Data Abstraction | TBD | 1, 2 segments of code are provided, one with a named list. The written response is great and the code segments are distinguished |
| Managing Complexity | TBD | 0, The list does not manage complexity. The explanation of how the program could be written differently without lists and how lists were helpful is inaccurate. |
| Procedural Abstraction | TBD | 1 |
| Algorithm Implementation | TBD | 1 |
| Testing | TBD | 1 |
