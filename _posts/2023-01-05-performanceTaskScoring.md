# Submission 1

| Reporting Category | My Scoring | Collegeboard Score + Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0, Does not have distinguished program purpose, instead, it is too broad and just described the functionality. Everything was good except the written response. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1, 2 segments of code are provided, one with a named list. The written response is great and the code segments are distinguished |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0, The list does not manage complexity. The explanation of how the program could be written differently without lists and how lists were helpful is inaccurate. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1, there is a developed and named procedure with 3 parameters used and referenced later on in the code. The output response includes code that calls the procedure again. The student describes how the procedure functions and it is essential to the program overall. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 1, the student incorporated their own algorithm within their procedure. They used selection (if), sequencing, and iteration (for in range loop). The written response is detailed explaining how the algorithm functions in the procedure, so it could be remade. |
| Testing | 1 | 1, The written response describes two different calls to the procedure with different parameters. For each call, the student describes the conditions that are being tested. Lastly, the results of both of the calls are described. | 

# Submission 2 

| Reporting Category | My Score + Explanation | Collegeboard Score + Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1, The response specifies the program’s purpose as entertainment. It describes how it functions, the input of "placing and removing tiles" and the output of patterns. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1, 2 code segments are provided. One of the multiple list's name is startGrid. The response says what is being stored in the list, which is the possible tiles on the screen. |
| Managing Complexity | 0, does not include the procedure name in the list. | 1, The response includes code that uses a list to manage complexity. It explains how the code could not be written without using a list. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1, The response includes a created procedure, "replaceList", with 2 parameters, current and replacement. The response also includes a description of the functionality and a call to this procedure. The response describes the functionality of the procedure. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1, The created algorithm in the procedure, replaceList, includes sequencing, selection and iteration. The response explains how the algorithm functions can be recreated in another way. |
| Testing | 1 | 1, The response describes 2 different calls to the procedure which results in different code being ran through. The response states that the second call is “parameter inputs of 2, 1, being the current and replacement parameters respectively.” The response describes both of the conditions being tested. | 

##  Create Performance Task scoring on these examples will help me exceed CPT requirements because it gives me good and bad examples of the written portion. It helps me figure out what is required, what is extra, and what is not needed in the explanation. The scoring will help me realize what I need included in my written response. 

# Submission 3
| Reporting Category | My Score + Explanation | Collegeboard Score + Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0, The video satisfies the first three criteria for the video. But the response describes the function of the program but not its purpose, it describes the functionality demonstrated in the video. The response describes the input and the output. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1, Two code segments are provided. The first segment shows data being stored in "firstCharacterList", and a second segment shows data being accessed from the list in a loop via a parameter that is set to the identified list. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1, The response includes a list that combines six rankings and an image URL for a single character into one collection to pass to the function that determines a winner, managing complexity in the program code. The response provides an accurate explanation about what would happen if the list were not used. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1, The response includes a made-up procedure, findWinner, with two parameters that are used in the procedure. The response also includes another code segment that illustrates a call to the findWinner procedure. The response describes the function of the procedure. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1, The findWinner includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (for loop). The response explains in detail how the algorithm in the procedure works so it can be recreated. |
| Testing | 1 | 1, The response describes two calls to the procedure with different arguments that lead to different results from the procedure. The first call uses the arguments Vision and Bishop. The second call uses the arguments Carnage and Venom. The response describes the conditions being tested for the two procedure calls. | 

# Submission 4

|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1, The video demonstrates the running of the program, collecting input using a text entry field and displaying output results on the screen showing letters that matched. The response states that the program’s purpose is “to test critical thinking skills.” The response describes the functionality demonstrated in the video. The response describes the input and the output. | 
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0, Two distinct code segments are provided. The first segment shows storage of data in a list named guesses. However, in the second code segment, data stored in the list is not being used; only the length of the list is accessed. So the response does not meet this criteria. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0, The response includes a program code segment that uses a list, but the list is not used to manage complexity. The use of the list is merely to act as a counter, so it can be replaced with a single counter variable. The response does not explain how the list manages complexity. The response refers to the list wordList, which is not identified, so this part of the response is irrelevant. This is implausible since the program could just use a counter. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 1, The response includes a student-developed procedure, isitcorrect, with one explicit parameter, checkanswer, and a call to this procedure in a second code segment using the argument, answer. The response describes the functionality of the procedure although it misnames the procedure. It also describes how it contributes to the overall program. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1, The student-developed algorithm within procedure isitcorrect includes sequencing, selection (an if statement), and iteration (a repeat loop). The response explains how the algorithm works in detail.|
| Testing | 0 | 0, The response gives the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments that cause a different segment of code to execute. Arguments should be specific values used in the call to the procedure. The response describes the conditions being tested for the cases. The response describes what would result in each condition. |
