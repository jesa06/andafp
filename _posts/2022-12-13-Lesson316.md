<li>a way to simulate real-world environments to test safety or logistics. It's important to use random numbers, consider biases, and consider if a simulation is the best solution.</li>
<li>useful:<ul>
<li>because they are safe, inexpensive, repeatable, and accurately model how something would be in the real world</li>
<li>predicting how something will happen in future based on previously collected data</li>
<li>model complicated situations to manage key aspects</li>

<li>Safer: Many safety hazards that can be encountered through experimentation can be avoided with simulations. Ex: Designing a boat to travel to an island</li>
<li>Less Expensive: Since real world equipment isn’t needed to make and run a simulation (only computer and programmer needed), this makes simulations an inexpensive way to test something. Ex: Boat example again</li>
<li>Repeatable: Once a simulation is created, it’s easy to repeat it to get different but similar results.</li>
<li>Can Make Predictions: Something that can’t be done with experiments is making predictions. Simulations are useful for this because previous data can be used to predict what will happen in the future. Ex: Global population</li>

| Joselyn Elise Anda | |
| 1. | A | 
| 2. | A |
| 3. What is not a reason to use a pseudo-random number generator when making a simulation? | C: To make the simulation more accurate. Because we use a pseudo-random number generator to mock imperfections from the real world and to save resources |
| 4. Which of the following is the least likely factor to be removed from a flight(air traffic) simulation for functionality? | C: Imperfections on aircraft |
| 5. What is not (usually) a difference between a experiment and a simulation? | C: Situation considered |
| 6. A car company needs to know how safe it's customers will be if it's new car crashes | A: Simulation |
| 7: A environmental group wants an accurate guess on the impact the greenhouse effect will have on the environment | B: Experiment/calculation |
| 9: A teacher want's to find the average score from a final | B: Experiment/calculation |</li>

<li><p>You want to figure out what would happen when lava is sitting out. Will it stay lava, freeze/harden, or evaporate? In the real world, where are you going to get lava and have the tools necessary to conduct this experiment. We can make a prediction for this simulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In this simulation you have lava and tools necessary to handle the lava. Examine the how long the process takes of hardening.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prediction:Depending on the temperature and environment around, if the temperature is colder and we wait a long time the lava will cool. If the temperature is warmer or hotter and we do not wait a long time, the lava will remain liquid.</p>

<li>Bad weather (keep a neutral weather)</li>
<li>Animals</li>
<li>Manmade things around it </li>
<li>Human interactions with it </li>

<li><p>In this simulation you can control the weather, nothing unnaturally made is in the setting. You can control time, and how fast time goes by.</p>
