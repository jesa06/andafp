    <h1 id="my-feature">My Feature</h1>
<p>My feature is a page that has a weather forecast and also a map. These will be connected to 2 different REST API’s, one from Google and one from RapidAPI. The weather will help people decide how to dress for the occasion, for example if it were cold they would layer up and dress warmer. It will also help them decide on the actual activities they wanat to do or places they want to go. If they wanted to hike, but checked the forecast for that day and saw there would be a storm, they would reschedule or choose a different activity. The map will help people decided on transportation and routes to take. It will act like a GPS, hopefully, and provide the ETA. The length of their location and the actual landmark could be a big factor because some people would not want to travel to far to make sure it fits their schedules.</p>

      <td>The purpose of the map and weather page is to help the users narrow down on the activities and places they want to visit. The weather and location of places help people determine what they want to wear, the best time/day to go, which transportation to take, or even if they want to go to the place at all.</td>

      <td>✅ includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration ✅ explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Testing</td>
      <td>✅ describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. ✅ describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure. ✅ identifies the result of each call</td>
      <td>The different arguments will be the different locations that I decide to test in the video. I will show the different results of each call, so the weather and how far the location is from my location will be the results.</td>

<h1 id="code-plan">Code plan</h1>
<p>My plan for the code is using Javascript to access the API and GET data from it. I will display the data using HTML and input that data into a table. I will also incorporate HTML buttons and an input space for people to enter the city in San Diego County that they wanted to check, and a button that onclick will actually GET the data and POST it into the table. Each time they put in a new city the backend code will UPDATE the data that is in the table and DELETE it, replacing with new data. i do not yet know how I will get a functional map into the page, but I will look into that and do more research on how to incorporate a functional live map on the page.</p>
<h1 id="video-plan">Video plan</h1>
<p>In the video I will choose a city that I was planning to visit. Then I would enter the city in the search bar to check the weather forecast and data will be inputted into the table. I will then go to the map and map how far my location is from the place I want to visit. Then on a little note box that I am planning to incorporate, I will chose which way of transportation I will be taking and what time I would leave. Then I would show going back to the weather section and change the city to a different destination, I will then do the same for the map. And then I will decide on which place I want to go to, and in my notes plan what type of clothing I would wear and how I would get to that location.</p>
