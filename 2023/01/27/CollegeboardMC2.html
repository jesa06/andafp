    <h1 id="score">Score</h1>
<p>My overall score was a 44/50. I did better than I expected and compared to the last Collegeboard Multiple Choice Test, I understood much more material and it took me much less time. A lot of the questions, I realized, were topics covered in the weeks that each group became the teacher, learned about a certain topic and taught it to the class.

<h1 id="questions-i-got-wrong">Questions I got wrong</h1>

<p><img src="/andafp/images/q1.png" alt="Q1" /></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The correct answer</em>: D. x = 3, y = 2, z = 1</li>
  <li><em>My answer</em>: I chose answer A. x = 1, y = 2, z = 3, which actually works with the code segment. But, the question was asking for which set of values does the code <em>not</em> work as intended</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/andafp/images/question2.png" alt="Q2" /></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The correct answer</em>: D. Nothing is displayed; the program results in an infinite loop.</li>
  <li><em>My answer</em>: I chose answer C. The number 10 is displayed. I am still kind of confused on why the answer is that the code will result in an infinite loop so I will review the videos related to this topic.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/andafp/images/question3.png" alt="Q3" /></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The correct answer</em>: B. 3y</li>
  <li><em>My answer</em>: I chose answer A. y+3. The value of the variable result is initially set to 0. The outer REPEAT block is executed three times, and the inner REPEAT block is executed y times. Any block inside both of these blocks will be executed 3y (3 multiplied by y) times. Since the innermost block increases the value of the variable  result by 1, the final value of the variable  result is 3y.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/andafp/images/question4.png" alt="Q4" /></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The correct answer</em>: C. The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns false. This is because the REPEAT UNTIL statement subtracts 2 from the parameter number until the condition number ≤ 0 is true. After this REPEAT loop ends, the value of number is either 0 (if the original number was even) or –1 (if the original number was odd).</li>
  <li><em>My answer</em>: I chose answer A. The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is 2, and it otherwise returns false. This is because f the initial value of number is 4, the REPEAT UNTIL loop will reduce the value of number to 2, and then to 0, at which point the loop will terminate. The procedure will return true, not false.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/andafp/images/question5.png" alt="Q5" /></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The correct answer</em>: C. <img src="/andafp/images/moveandturn.png" alt="A5" /></li>
  <li><em>My answer</em>: I chose answer B. <img src="/andafp/images/wrongone.png" alt="Wrong5" />. The answer I chose did not rotate the robot the correct number of times to be oriented towards the end goal.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/andafp/images/question6.png" alt="Q6" /></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The correct answer</em>: B. <img src="/andafp/images/answerB.jpeg" alt="A6" />.  The robot turns to the right one, two, or three times and then moves one or two squares forward. The possible final locations are to the right, below, or to the left of the starting position.</li>
  <li><em>My answer</em>: I chose answer C. <img src="/andafp/images/answerC.jpeg" alt="wrongA6" /> It is wrong because the robot turns right one, two, or three times and could end up in a square to the left of its initial position. It cannot end up in a square above its initial position.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-will-do-to-improve">What I will do to improve</h1>
<ul>
  <li>In order to improve on my skills and take in more knowledge, I will review the videos that Collegeboard provides for each question that I got wrong. I will then rework the problems tha challenge dme to see if I more deeply understand</li>
  <li>Another thing I could do is use Khan Academy tools and watch their videos as well as do their practices and quizzes. Khan Academy is a great and efficient learning tool.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>Overall, I think I did great on this multiple choice quiz. Last time, it took me a lot of more time to digest what the questions were asking and then understand how I could even decide the answer. I understood the majority of the topics on this quiz almost after a minute or two with multiple reads. Last quiz I asked my dad and my peers for some help on a lot of the questions I did not understand. But, this one I did mostly on my own. From the last multiple choice, I feel like I have actually learned a lot more, even if it is the most basic knowledge. Before this quiz I was really discouraged about my progress and felt like I have not really learned much or made any progress, but from my results and the way I got through this quiz, I think I am on track so far in APCSP.</p>
