|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0, The video demonstrates the running of the program, displaying icons of animals and questions, inputting the text of the guesses, and displaying the final result. The response states that the program’s purpose is “The purpose of this code is for you to see all the animals and to identify them when you’re asked later” This states the function of the program but not its intended purpose. This statement does not state the problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program. The response does not describe the functionality demonstrated in the video. The response states, “Challenge the users memory to remember the animals shown on the screen.” This
response does not describe the functionality shown in the video. The response describes the input and the output; however, the response switches the input with the output and vice versa. | 
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0, 2 different code segments are provided: one shows storage of data in a list named animalImages; however, the second code segment shows another list named
animalList. The response identifies animalList, but animalList is not being used in either code segment. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0, The response does not include a program code segment that uses a list to manage complexity. Both code segments show data being stored in a list, but neither contain code using a list. The code is not complex. The response does not explain how the list manages complexity. The response does not explain how it would be written differently without the list, and the code does not manage or even involve complexity.|
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0, The response includes a student-developed procedure, evaluateGuess, with one explicit parameter, guess, and a call to this procedure in a second code segment using the argument guess. The response describes the functionality of the procedure as it states that it contributes to “determining if the user’s guess was right or wrong.” The response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0, The student-developed algorithm within procedure, evaluateGuess, includes sequencing, and iteration (a for loop), and selection (an if statement). The response includes a minimal description, but it does not explain how the algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it. |
| Testing | 0 | 1, The response describes two different calls to the specific procedure to result in different code being executed. The response describes the conditions being tested. The response states the other condition being tested is “when evalulateGuess is not equal to one of the animals in animalList.” The response describes the results of the two calls, leading to two different results.|</p>

| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1, The video demonstrates the running of the program, showing input into the program through keyboard typing. Output includes the prompts for the word input and the poems being displayed. The response specifies the program’s purpose as creative expression, “to explore the user’s creativity through the expression of poetry using their words and images as well as preferences of formatting in order to generate some unique poems.” The response describes the functionality demonstrated in the video. The response describes the input and the output. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1, Two distinct code segments are provided, the first showing data being stored in the identified list and the second showing the data being accessed from the identified list under a new name since it is passed as a parameter. The name of the list is identified as nounList, although it is also referred to as wordList when it is passed into the selectWord procedure. The response identifies what is stored in the list. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1, The response includes code that uses lists of words to manage complexity when generating poetry. The response explains how the code would be written differently without the list. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 1, The response includes a student-developed procedure, createPoems, with four parameters that are used in the procedure. The response describes the functionality of the procedure as it states that it is “putting together the final selection of poems.” The response describes how the procedure contributes to the overall program by stating that it is used in conjunction with the user inputs. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1, The student-developed algorithm within procedure, createPoems, includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (while loop). The response explains in detail how the algorithm in the procedure works so it can be recreated. |
| Testing | 1 | 1, The response describes two calls to the specific procedure to result in different code being executed, varying the argument for the last parameter. The first call is
createPoems(nounList, verbList, adverbList, 1), and the second call is createPoems(nounList, verbList, adverbList, 0). The response states that the last parameter represents “differing settings for articlePreference.” The response describes the condition being tested. The response specifies the different results of the two procedure calls. The response states in the first case that “the final output poems will have “The” and “And” in the content.” The responses states in the second case that “the final output poems will not have “The” and “And” in the content.” |</p>
