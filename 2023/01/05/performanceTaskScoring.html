<h1 id="submission-3">Submission 3</h1>
<p>| Reporting Category | My Score + Explanation | Collegeboard Score + Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0, The video satisfies the first three criteria for the video. But the response describes the function of the program but not its purpose, it describes the functionality demonstrated in the video. The response describes the input and the output. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1, Two code segments are provided. The first segment shows data being stored in “firstCharacterList”, and a second segment shows data being accessed from the list in a loop via a parameter
that is set to the identified list. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1, The response includes a list that combines six rankings and an image URL for a single character into one collection to pass to the function that determines a winner, managing
complexity in the program code. The response provides an accurate explanation about what would happen if the list were not used. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1, The response includes a made-up procedure, findWinner, with two parameters that are used in the procedure. The response also includes another code segment that
illustrates a call to the findWinner procedure. The response describes the function of the procedure. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1, The findWinner includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (for loop). The response explains in detail how the algorithm in the procedure works so it can be
recreated. |
| Testing | 1 | 1, The response describes two calls to the procedure with different arguments that lead to different results from the procedure. The first call uses the arguments Vision and Bishop. The second call uses the arguments Carnage and Venom. The response describes the conditions being tested for the two procedure calls. |</p>

<h1 id="submission-4">Submission 4</h1>
<p>| Reporting Category | My Score + Explanation | Collegeboard Score + Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1, The video demonstrates the running of the program, collecting input using a text entry field and displaying output results on the screen showing letters that matched. The response states that the program’s purpose is “to test critical thinking skills.” The response describes the functionality demonstrated in the video. The response describes the input and the output. | 
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0, Two distinct code segments are provided. The first segment shows storage of data in a list named guesses. However, in the second code segment, data stored in the list is not being
used; only the length of the list is accessed. So the response does not meet this criteria. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0, The response includes a program code segment that uses a list, but the list is not used to manage complexity. The use of the list is merely to act as a counter, so it can be replaced with a single counter variable. The response does not explain how the list manages complexity. The response refers to the list wordList, which is not identified, so this part of the response is irrelevant. This is implausible since the program could just use a counter. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 1, The response includes a student-developed procedure, isitcorrect, with one explicit parameter, checkanswer, and a call to this procedure in a second code segment using the
argument, answer. The response describes the functionality of the procedure although it misnames the procedure. It also describes how it contributes to the overall program. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1, The student-developed algorithm within procedure isitcorrect includes sequencing, selection (an if statement), and iteration (a repeat loop). The response explains how the algorithm works in detail.|
| Testing | 0 | 0, The response gives the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments that cause a different segment of code to execute. Arguments should be specific values used in the
call to the procedure. The response describes the conditions being tested for the cases. The response describes what would result in each condition. |</p>
