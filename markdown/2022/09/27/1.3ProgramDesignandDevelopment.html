<ol>
  <li>How is a program developed?
    <ul>
      <li>Investigation: define requirements, understand the constraints, understand user concerns and interests</li>
      <li>Investigate with surveys, direct observation, interviews, and user testing (prototype)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design the program
    <ul>
      <li>brainstorm</li>
      <li>storyboard</li>
      <li>plan user experience</li>
      <li>layout user interface (what user has to do…audio, click, interact)</li>
      <li>organize into modules (small parts of program)</li>
      <li>develop testing strategy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Decide on program requirements
    <ul>
      <li>how the program should behave</li>
      <li>include a list of user interactions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The program specifications outline all of the requirements</li>
  <li>Create a prototype
    <ul>
      <li>incremental process to frequently refine modules of the program</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Test! At micro level and macro level.</li>
  <li>Program documentation: describe the overall program, list the program’s procedures and methods in the code, talk about the development of the program, include how other coders/programs can interact with yours
    <ul>
      <li>this happens throughout the whole programming</li>
      <li>it can improve the efficiency overall</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Programs are not usually made by one person</em>
<em>Make sure to source codes from other people and include the original programmer</em>
<em>Individuals/teams work on certain parts</em>
<em>Names must be written in the documentation of the program including their contributions…can be in comments within the programming language</em></p>

<h2 id="hacks">
<a class="anchor" href="#hacks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hacks</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Brain Write. The process of just elaborating on ideas and sharing them with your team.:
    <ul>
      <li>to make our game more original maybe we can customize it with coding facts and ideas on each block</li>
      <li>maybe people can chose a theme like default, seasonal ones, or colors</li>
      <li>we should probably code together while one watches to catch mistakes, and then rerun the whole thing so we can catch errors more easily</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Wire Frame, Concept. Before coding start to outline what the project will look like.
    <ul>
      <li>the intro will be either click here or press this button on the keyboard to start the game</li>
      <li>the intro slide will also have a change theme button</li>
      <li>there will be a button that shows a record of all of the players, in the order of the highest scores</li>
      <li>when the game ends, it will display their input name and score and it will show their place in the record of all players, placing them based on score</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modeling or UML. Before coding what data will you need. Think about data behavior, data interaction, or data description. Modeling and UML help with visualization.
    <ul>
      <li>we will need to use python to build the structures of the blocks</li>
      <li>we will need to use javascript for the players to use the arrow keys for playing and maybe also the space bar or awsd</li>
      <li>we will need to use html for the outlook/frontend for the color blocks and designs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Frontend. Wire Frame development is better than coding, at early stages. But if you have clear idea and can articulate it in HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Backend. Jupyter notebooks is a great way to thing about data and outputs. Often a console program can help you imagine data as well as interaction.</li>

<a class="anchor" href="#difficult-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Difficult Problem</h1>

<ol>
  <li>In the following procedure, the parameter max is a positive integer.</li>
</ol>

<p>PROCEDURE printNums(max)</p>

<p>{
count ← 1</p>

<p>REPEAT UNTIL(count &gt; max)</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DISPLAY(count)</p>

<p>count ← count + 2</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>}</p>

<p>Which of the following is the most appropriate documentation to appear with the printNums procedure?</p>

<p>A) Prints all positive even integers that are less than or equal to max.</p>

<p>B) Prints all positive odd integers that are less than or equal to max.</p>

<p>C) Prints all positive even integers that are greater than max.</p>

<p>D) Prints all positive odd integers that are greater than max.</p>

<p><em>Answer B</em>
<em>Correct. The procedure initializes count to 1. Inside the loop, the value of count is displayed, then count is incremented by 2 to the next odd integer. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so all positive odd integers less than or equal to max are printed.</em></p>
