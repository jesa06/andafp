- ### Links
    - Look up <href> and []() syntax in both HTML and Markdown. These should become easy and familiar.

- ### Git- coordinating work among programmers to develop source code/source code management
- ### Jupyter Notebook- to edit and run notebook documents
- ### Bash- command-line interpreter or user shell used to interpret user commands

## Languages
- ### Python
- ### Java/Javascript

## Sample of Python Variables

### variable of type string
name = "Joselyn Anda"
 print("name", name, type(name))
- name is a key
- joselyn anda is a value
### variable of type integer
 age = 16
 print("age", age, type(age))
- age is a key
- 16 is a value
### variable of type float
score = 90.0
 print("score", score, type(score))
- score is a key
- 90.0 is a value
 print()

### variable of type list (many values in one variable)
 langs = ["Python", "JavaScript", "Java", "Bash"]
 print("langs", langs, type(langs))
 print("- langs[3]", langs[3], type(langs[3]))
- langs is a key
- ["Python", "Javascript", "Java", "Bash"] is a value
print()

### variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values)
person = {
    "name": name,
    "age": age,
    "score": score,
    "langs": langs
}
### print("person", person, type(person))
  ### print('- person["name"]', person["name"], type(person["name"]))

 ## Lists & Dictionary
- ### a *list* is in square brackets []
- ### a *dictionary* is in curly brackets {}
- ### an *integer* is just a whole number
