My birthday is January 15, 2006

My favorite color is red!

I have been doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since 2012

My favorite food is a filipino dish called Picadillo and also my papa's steak. My favorite drink/dessert is thai milk tea with boba.

I *love* music, especially singing and I am the Vice President of choir at Del Norte. I also am in Chamber Choir of Del Norte. In chamber choir, we sing the National Anthem at some of the home games for football. Occasionally we perform at pep rallies during lunch.
