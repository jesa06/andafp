## A Little Bit More About Me

Hello everyone! 

My name is Joselyn Elise Soriano Anda and I am apart of Del Norte Highschool in the class of '24 

My birthday is January 15, 2006

My favorite color is red!

I have been doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since 2012

I *love* music, especially singing and I am the Vice President of choir at Del Norte. I also am in Chamber Choir of Del Norte.
