    "> Data abstraction is in play when we save files.  It is common in working with files to refer to file formats as Image formats, Audio formats, and Video formats, all of these are often called ***Binary File formats**.   In Web Application like Chrome, Safari, Edge they all focus on the usage of HTTP, or text file display like HTML.  Thus, [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) utilities convert binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode/Number abstractions) into a text encoded scheme 0f (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits).  Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.\n",

In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer.  Buffering is sometimes implemented directly in hardware or other times it is a combination of hardware and software.  \n",
