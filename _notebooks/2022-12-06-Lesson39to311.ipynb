    "- Different algorithms can be developed or used to solve the same problem\n",
    "- Algorithms can be created from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms.\n",
    "- Knowledge of existing algorithms can help in constructing new ones. Some existing algorithms include: Determining the maximum or minimum value of two or more numbers. Computing the sum or average of two or more numbers. Identifying if an integer is or is not evenly divisible by another integer. Determining a robot’s path through a maze.\n",

    "- *Binary Search (Efficient search)*: repeats the process of finding a median and evaluating \n",
