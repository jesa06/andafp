    "\n",
    "> A hashtable is a data structure with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a **dictionary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The typical time complexity of a hashtable is **O(1)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Looking for a value in a dictionary would have a time complexity of O(1), because each key only has 1 value. If you know what the key is you will know what the value is.\n"

    "## What is Hashing and Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- duplicate key = collision \n",
    "- no need to hash in Python dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary.\n",

Not saying that I have been in love but I have experienced things that confirm her lyrics to be true, how \"boys only want love when it's torture\", or how \"she doesn't get your humor like I do\" and \"I know you better than that. Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?\" GUYS LITERALLY SUCK MR.YEUNG. TAYLOR SWIFT GETS ME THROUGH STUFF. Like a girl could have it all, be so well-rounded: smart, funny, has passions and goals and be decently pretty, but a guy would throw all of that away to be with a really pretty girl with much less attributes (no offense to her). But all throughout these failed relationships Taylor Swift was able to bounce back and keep growing. She did not lose sight of herself or change herself for these useless men.
